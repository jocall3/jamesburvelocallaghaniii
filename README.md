## üöÄ Launching the Ascent üöÄ

1.  **API Key Configuration (CRUCIAL):**
    *   This application **requires** a Google Gemini API key.
    *   The key **MUST** be set as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
    *   The application reads this key via `process.env.API_KEY`. Ensure your development/deployment environment makes this variable accessible to the JavaScript runtime.
    *   **Without a valid API key, AI functionalities will be disabled.**

2.  **Open the Chronicle:**
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports ES6 modules and the features leveraged (like SpeechSynthesis).

3.  **Begin the Journey:**
    *   If it's your first time (or after a reset), the genesis chapter will be automatically generated.
    *   Make choices to guide O'Callaghan.
    *   Consult the Oracle.
    *   Witness the unfolding of an epic intellectual saga.
